# Rhythm

## Overview

Rythm is a straightforward project designed to explore 3D graphics and DirectX programming. This project aims to provide a hands-on learning experience with fundamental rendering techniques and shader implementation. The primary focus is on basic DirectX operations and shader programming rather than on complex gameplay features.

## Features

- **Rendering**: Implements basic Phong shading for 3D graphics.
- **Interaction**: Click to sync with the beat; the sphere color changes based on your timing.
- **Audio**: Utilizes SoLoud for audio playback. The current granularity for beat detection is limited, as play time is averaged from `std::chrono` and SoLoud, but this approach was chosen to avoid integrating another sound library.

## Technical Details

- **Engine**: The engine is simple and not heavily optimized, reflecting its purpose as a learning tool.
- **Shaders**: Currently uses only Phong shading, with no advanced shaders implemented.
- **Meshes**: Loaded using Assimp.
- **Audio**: Handled with SoLoud.

## Learning Resources

This project was heavily influenced by ChilliTomatoNoodle's DirectX tutorials on YouTube. Although the implementation is original, the methods align with the tutorial's teachings due to the limited availability of comprehensive DirectX resources.

## Music

The music featured in the project was generated by https://mubert.com/render.

## Note

This project was created primarily for educational purposes. As such, it does not emphasize extensive gameplay or optimization. The focus was on understanding and applying DirectX concepts and basic graphics programming.

Feel free to explore the code and learn from the simple structure and implementation details!
